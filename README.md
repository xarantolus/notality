# Notality
Notality is a very simple note taking app. I mostly built it to learn how Flutter works, but it's functional and you can use it.

### Features
* Create, edit, delete and reorder notes
* Automatic dark/light mode depending on the system-wide setting
* Localization for English and German

Notes can be deleted by swiping them to the left or to the right. A note can be relocated by holding and moving it to a new position in the list.
If you want to change the date/time of a note, just open it and tap the date shown under the title.
